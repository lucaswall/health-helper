name: push-to-roadmap
description: Deep research and discussion of a new idea to evaluate whether it belongs on the roadmap. Gathers extensive context from codebase, web, APIs, MCPs, and project history, then presents a concise analysis report with feasibility assessment, design considerations, and questions for interactive discussion. After discussion, writes a complete feature spec to the roadmap file following its conventions. Use when user says "push to roadmap", "add to roadmap", "roadmap this idea", or wants to evaluate and document a feature idea for future implementation.

Deep research, interactive discussion, and roadmap authoring for a new feature idea. You gather extensive context, present findings, discuss with the user to refine the concept, then write a complete feature spec to the roadmap file.

## Phase 1: Input Resolution

1. **Parse $ARGUMENTS** — Extract the feature idea or problem description. This is always a new idea being evaluated for the roadmap.

2. **Read the roadmap file** — Look for `ROADMAP.md` in the project root (or discover the roadmap file path from CLAUDE.md). If found:
   - Read the full file including its Conventions section (if any)
   - Check existing features for overlap or conflict with the proposed idea
   - Note the file's structure and conventions for Phase 5
   - If the idea already exists as a feature, tell the user and ask if they want to refine the existing entry instead

3. **Read CLAUDE.md** — Load project context, tech stack (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Clean Architecture), conventions. Extract the team name from the Linear Integration section if it exists.

## Phase 2: Deep Research

Launch parallel research to build comprehensive context. Use Task agents for independent research streams. Launch all independent streams simultaneously.

### Research Stream 1: Codebase Analysis

Use Task with `subagent_type=Explore` (thoroughness: "very thorough"). Explore the codebase for everything related to this idea:
- **Current implementation** — What exists today that's relevant? What would this feature touch?
- **Architecture** — How does the current system work in the affected areas? (domain/data/presentation layers, ViewModels, UseCases, Repositories)
- **Patterns** — What conventions and patterns are established? (Hilt modules, Composable patterns, StateFlow usage, `@Inject` constructor injection)
- **Tests** — What test coverage exists in related areas? (JUnit 5 + MockK patterns, Turbine for flows)
- **Dependencies** — What libraries/APIs are already in use that relate? (check `build.gradle.kts` and `gradle/libs.versions.toml`)

### Research Stream 2: External Research

Use Task with `subagent_type=general-purpose` and `model=opus`. Search the web for technical context:
- **API feasibility** — If the feature involves external APIs or Android platform APIs (Health Connect, Google Fit, device sensors), research actual capabilities, pricing, limitations, device compatibility
- **Technical approaches** — How have others solved this in Android/Kotlin? What are the trade-offs?
- **Gotchas** — Known issues, limitations, or surprises others have encountered (e.g., Android lifecycle pitfalls, Compose performance issues, Health Connect permission model quirks)
- **User context relevance** — Use project context from CLAUDE.md (target audience, device targets, scale, constraints) to evaluate feasibility through the user's actual lens

**CRITICAL:** Look for real user experiences, developer forums, actual API responses — not just documentation promises or marketing pages. Evidence over claims.

### Research Stream 3: Project Context

Use Task with `subagent_type=Explore` or direct tool calls. Check project state:
- **Linear issues** — Query existing Backlog/Todo/In Progress issues for related or overlapping work (if Linear MCP available)
- **Roadmap dependencies** — Does this idea depend on or block existing roadmap items?
- **Recent changes** — Any recent commits or PRs that affect this area?

### Research guidelines

- Launch independent streams in parallel for speed
- Each stream should return specific, evidence-based findings
- Include any relevant MCP context if they inform feasibility
- If the feature involves UI, examine existing Composable patterns and relevant screens

## Phase 3: Analysis Report

After all research completes, synthesize findings into a concise report. Output directly to the conversation:

```
## Feature Analysis: [Feature Name]

### Current State
[What exists today in the codebase that's relevant. 2-3 sentences.]

### Key Findings
[Numbered list of the most important discoveries. Each finding should be specific and evidence-backed.]

### Feasibility Assessment
[Honest assessment of whether this feature is feasible, practical, and valuable. Include device compatibility, Health Connect limitations, technical, or cost concerns.]

### Design Considerations
[Key decisions that need to be made. What are the main approaches? What trade-offs exist?]

### Recommendations
[Whether to add to roadmap, defer, drop, or split. Explain why.]

### Open Questions
[Genuine questions for the user that would affect the feature design.]
```

**Keep it concise.** Details were gathered for YOUR reasoning. The user gets insights and conclusions.

## Phase 4: Interactive Discussion

After presenting the report, the conversation continues naturally:

- Answer questions with specific evidence from the research
- Explore alternative approaches if the user pushes back
- Do additional targeted research if new angles come up
- Help the user shape the feature — refine the problem, goal, design, and edge cases through conversation
- Take note of decisions made during discussion — these feed directly into the feature spec

**Do NOT rush to writing.** The discussion ends when the user explicitly indicates a decision:
- "Add it" / "put it on the roadmap" / "write it up" → proceed to Phase 5
- "Drop it" / "not worth it" → stop, nothing to write
- "Let me think about it" → stop, nothing to write
- "Actually, add this to the backlog instead" → tell the user to run `/add-to-backlog` with the refined description

## Phase 5: Write to Roadmap

When the user decides to add the feature to the roadmap:

1. **Read the roadmap file** to get current content and conventions.

2. **Draft the feature spec** following the roadmap file's conventions. The standard structure is:

   ```
   ## Feature Name

   ### Problem

   [What's wrong or missing. 2-3 sentences. Problem-focused, no solution language.]

   ### Prerequisites

   [Other features or Linear issues that must be done first. Omit section entirely if none.]

   ### Goal

   [What the feature achieves for the user. 1-2 sentences.]

   ### Design

   [The core: UX flows, behavior rules, UI details. Use sub-sections as needed for clarity.]

   ### Architecture

   [Technical decisions: storage, APIs, state management. Omit if purely UI.]

   ### Edge Cases

   [Non-obvious scenarios and how to handle them.]

   ### Implementation Order

   [Numbered list of steps, ordered by dependency.]
   ```

3. **Incorporate discussion decisions.** Everything agreed during Phase 4 goes into the spec. Do not invent details that weren't discussed — if something wasn't covered, either ask now or leave the section appropriately scoped.

4. **Present the draft** to the user in the conversation before writing. Show the full feature spec as markdown. Ask: **"Does this capture what we discussed? Any changes before I write it to the roadmap?"**

5. **After user approval**, write the feature to the roadmap file:
   - Insert the feature section before the Conventions section (or at the end if no Conventions section)
   - Add a `---` separator before the new feature (matching existing style)
   - Add a row to the Contents table with a linked feature name and one-sentence summary
   - Generate a stable slug anchor from the feature heading (lowercase, hyphens, never changes)
   - Check for cross-references: if existing features relate, add links where appropriate

6. **Verify** — Read the file after writing to confirm clean structure (no orphaned separators, no broken links, contents table in sync).

## Rules

- **Evidence over opinions** — Every finding must be backed by specific evidence (code paths, API docs, forum posts, data points)
- **Honest about uncertainty** — If you can't determine something, say so
- **User's context matters** — Use project context from CLAUDE.md (audience, device targets, scale, constraints) to inform the analysis
- **Don't oversell or undersell** — Present findings neutrally, let the user decide
- **Roadmap conventions** — Follow the roadmap file's conventions section for all modifications (if one exists)
- **No implementation** — This skill researches, discusses, and writes feature specs. It does NOT write code or create implementation plans
- **Concise reports** — Research is thorough, output is scannable
- **Draft before writing** — Always show the user the complete feature spec and get approval before modifying the roadmap file
- **Problem-focused writing** — Problem and Goal sections use user-facing language. Technical details belong in Architecture
- **No code in specs** — Reference file paths and patterns, but don't write implementation code in the roadmap
